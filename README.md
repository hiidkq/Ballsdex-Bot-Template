# Ballsdex-Bot-Template
# 🌍 **Ballsdex Bot Template (Easier) - DEMO** 🎮✨  

## ⚙️ **Setup & Configuration**  
This bot is a simplified **Ballsdex-style** template, making it super easy to use! 🚀  

🔹 **Set up a spawn channel:**  
👉 Use **`/setup-channel {channel}`** to choose where characters will appear.  
🔹 The bot will send a 📜 **Terms of Service** message before activation. ❌ **No farming allowed!**  
📖 Read the full **Terms & Conditions** here: [🔗 Click Here](https://gist.github.com/laggron42/52ae099c55c6ee1320a260b0a3ecac4e).  

✅ Once you accept, the bot will **start spawning characters randomly** after a quick **5-second wait**. ⏳  

---

## 🎲 **How Spawning Works**  
💬 **Characters appear at random times but only when users are actively chatting!**  
⏳ If a character isn’t caught within **1 minute**, it **despawns** and the button gets disabled.  
🏆 If someone catches it first, the button will **also disable** since it was claimed.
